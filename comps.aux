Following from point a, as an external field is applied, the total field reaches point b. As the external field is reduced to 0, since the ferromagnet partially keeps it alignment, a nonzero magnetic field exists even without an external field, point c. By applying a field in the opposite direction as before, the net field drops to zero, point d. Then applying an even stronger field will align the ferromagnet to that field reaching point e. Then to points f and g as the external field is decreased. This is important because the retainment of magnetic field by the ferromagnet means that it can store information without needing an outside, non-volatile \cite  {modernPhysics}.}}{19}{}}

But, the AFM wanting to stay aligned with the FM applies a torque on it to try to keep it from rotating. So a stronger external field is needed to rotate the FM than if the AFM was not there. v) After a strong enough field is applied and the FM aligned left, the AFM still tries to align with the FM applying a torque to rotate the FM right. So, a weaker external field can rotate the field right. This means that the FM has a preferred alignment to the right because of the AFM \cite  {schull}.}}{23}{}}
