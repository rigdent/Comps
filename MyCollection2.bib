Specifically, how optical disks are made whether they're a CD-ROM or CD-R. Also used this to learn about the layout of the disc and how pits and lands are used to store data. Lastly, I used this to learn about how you can increase density by decreasing the pit size by decreasing the beam size (increase resolvability).}

The leading theoretical models are summarized. Finally some of the factors controlling exchange bias as well as some of the unsolved issues associated with exchange bias are discussed.},
